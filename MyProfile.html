<h1><center><b>	My View about Empowerment Technology 👁️</h1></center></b>
								<ul>
												▶️What is ETECH?
												<br><br><br><br><br>
											<&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ETECH stands for Empowerment  Technology But for me i thinks its the study about computer like programming or fixing the computer itself. Etech also thought us about computer and Information similar on Grade 9 its like ICT[information Communication Technology] It can help us in many ways to make our jobs more easier because nowadays its the age of technology so it really matters and it such a great help.
								<br><br>
								
												▶️Did I learn something? What i can share?
												
												<br><br><br><br><br>
												<&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes I did learn Many Things. On my grade 9 i took ict and our study their continue now on Etech and I was able to learn many things like working on word,excel, powerpoint,Creating websites and many more. And i was able to gain experience in creating Activities especially this website it thought me that we can learn more on things we dont know we must focus on studying even simple things and it can help us.
												<br><br>
												▶️Recommendation:
												<br><br><br><br><br>
												<&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My recommendation is if you are taking a computer related course you much choose Ict and Empowerment Technology because it will be a great help when you are on collage or working.
